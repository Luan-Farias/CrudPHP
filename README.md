# Crud with PHP
This is just a simple crud maden in PHP, with connection in a MariaDB/MySQL Database. This crud I made when I were a  in PHP, and now I'm put here in github.

This CRUD has a simple interface and it's like this:
<div>
    <a href="#">Adicionar Usuario</a>
    <table border="1" width="100%">
        <tr>
            <th>ID</th>
            <th>Nome</th>
            <th>Email</th>
            <th>Ações</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>1</th>
            <th>Luan Farias</th>
            <th>luan.farias_bvs@outlook.com</th>
            <th>[Editar] [Excluir]</th>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

Just a simple interface like this serve to make a crud.
This CRUD was made with technique DAO (Data access object).
